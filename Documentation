Phase 1: Mapping your Dashboard
Based on your image, here is the structure we will use for the VBA code:

Calculation Sheet Path: Cell G7 (Named Range: CS_Path). This points to the specific Excel File containing your model logic.

PX Output Folder: Cell G9 (Named Range: PXOut_Path). This is the Folder where PX saves its raw result files.

Test Case Folder: Cell G11 (Named Range: PX_TC). This is the Folder where the generated PX test scripts will be saved.

Comparison/Report Path: Cell G13 (Named Range: Ver_Path). This is the Folder where the final Verification Report will be stored.

Phase 2: Expected Results Setup Instructions
Before running the macro, the tester must manually complete the mapping on the Setup tab to connect the test data to the model.

Step 1: Sync the Headers
Action: Run the Sync_Headers_From_Row5_With_Duplicate_Check macro.

Result: All unique headers from Row 5 of the Test_Cases sheet are pulled into Column B (starting at Row 10) of the Setup tab.

Validation: Confirm cell F2 says "Pass" (indicating no missing headers or duplicates).

Step 2: Map Inputs (The "Push" Logic)
For every header listed in Column B, the tester must manually enter:

Column C (Sheet Name): The exact name of the tab in the Calculation Sheet (defined in CS_Path) where this input belongs.

Column D (Cell): The specific cell address (e.g., $B$10) where the value should be pasted.

Logic: The macro will open the model, loop through your test cases, and "push" the data into these specific cells.

Step 3: Map Outputs (The "Pull" Logic)
On the right side of the Setup tab, the tester defines what results to capture:

Column G (Sheet Name): The tab in the model that contains the final calculated figures.

Column H (Range): The specific cell or range (e.g., $F$20:$G$25) that represents the "Expected Result."

Logic: After the inputs are pushed, the macro will "pull" the data from these cells and save them to the Extracted_PX_Data sheet.
